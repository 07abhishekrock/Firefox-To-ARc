An attempt to have keyboard like functionalities on firefox just like arc. (close enough :sweat-smile)

# How to build ?
1. go to tab-sidebar/sidebar-src -> here the main source for the sidebar is present
2. inside this directory run the script `build` or `buildWithoutTsc` to build the sidebar src files
